Massively-Multisinner-Confession-Booth
======================================

Removes legacy confessional booth frameworks built on hierarchical top-down structures 
in lieu of distributed peer-to-peer forgiveness networks.

Client applications will allow for USER A to 'confess' their sins, secrets, and guilty feelings
to USER B in private one-to-one socket connections. Forgivessness will be doled out from 
USER B. 

Reward systems will be in place for both confessing within the system so that the more
that you share of your own baggage, in turn, the more secrets and confessions a user would be allowed
to listen in on and offer forgiveness for.
